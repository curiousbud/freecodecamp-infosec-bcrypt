# 🔐 Information Security with HelmetJS - BCrypt

This repository serves as the **boilerplate** for the **BCrypt** lessons, part of the **FreeCodeCamp Information Security Certification**. These lessons will help you understand how to securely hash and store passwords using **BCrypt**, a popular and secure hashing algorithm.

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives

- Learn how to use **BCrypt** to securely hash passwords.
- Understand how to **salt** hashes to add additional security against rainbow table attacks.
- Implement and validate **password hashing** mechanisms in a real-world Express.js application.
  
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher recommended)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curiousbud/freecodecamp-infosecurity.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd freecodecamp-infosecurity
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 🔑 Key Features

- **BCrypt hashing**: Safely hash passwords before storing them in a database.
- **Salting passwords**: Add unique salt values to hashes to prevent pre-computed attack vectors.
- Integration with Express.js for handling user authentication and password storage.

## 📚 Lesson Instructions

To complete these lessons, follow the detailed instructions provided in the **FreeCodeCamp curriculum**:

## 🛠️ How BCrypt Works

- **Hashing**: BCrypt applies a secure hashing function to the password, ensuring the original password is not stored in plain text.
- **Salting**: Each hash is "salted" with a random value, making each hash unique even if the same password is used more than once.
- **Verification**: BCrypt provides methods to compare hashed passwords during user login to ensure the correct password was entered.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- **Never store passwords as plain text**: Always hash passwords before saving them to the database.
- **Use strong salts**: The stronger the salt, the better protected the passwords will be against pre-computed attacks.
- **Implement password strength checks**: Encourage users to create strong passwords by enforcing complexity requirements.
